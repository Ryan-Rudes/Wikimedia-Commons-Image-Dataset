*If you would like to contribute computational resources to this effort, simply message me at my preferred email address (ryanrudes@gmail.com), which is listed on my Github profile with a message in the following format:

> ### I Would Like To Contribute Computational Resources To This Dataset
> Hi, my name is __________ (this may be anonymous, if you'd like). <br/>
> My personal computer runs on __________ _GB_ of RAM. <br/>
> It uses the __________ operating system. <br/>
> I have tried to, and found that I can successfully run the most recent version of the data scraper on my computer/preferred location (ie. programming notebook). <br/>
> I am capable of providing a **maximum** of __________ _hours_ of computational time on my computer to this dataset. <br/>
> I can designate a **maximum** of __________ _gigabytes_ of disk memory to temporarily store the scraped images until they are added to the dataset, at which point, I can either choose to keep them, or simply delete them. <br/>
> I intend to contribute __________ _hours_ of computational time, and scrape a total of __________ _gigabytes_ of images. <br/>
> I have tested the most recent version of the program on my computer/preferred location (programming notebook, etc.), and after a few minutes of running a computing average speed, it prints "__________ images downloaded per second". <br/>

I will respond by sending a slightly modified copy of the Python file, adapted to data scrape a section of the database, with a size according to the amount of computational resources you stated were at your disposal and were willing to provide. Once this section is completed, send me the resulting "Images" folder compressed as a .zip file, and I will add your username to a new text file, credits.txt, alongside the amount of computational time you contributed.
